Database DRY- dont repeat yourself. Should we change the database structure to be simpler(ie one table with the credentials in it to keep it basic.)

Login Module: save user in session

Registration module: Check for duplicate on registration(easier if one table)

Profile Module: User needs to be able to edit user profile

Administration Module
	1. List Users
	2. Display user role and permissions
	3. Display user profile
	4. suspend a user
	5. delete a user
	6. Cannot delete or suspend self.
